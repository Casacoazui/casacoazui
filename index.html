                      <h2>Zoos</h2>
                      <p><img id="flamingo" src="images/flamingo.gif"  alt="" style="width:168px; height:168px;" >A couple of months ago, my kids and I went to the
                         Franklin Zoo here in Boston. We saw diverse kinds
                         of animals, but the one that caught my attention
                         was the gorilla and another strange animal that
                         I do not remember its name, but I remember their
                         sad faces. It must be hard for them to be in a
                         cage when they are wild animals, everyone likes
                         freedom.</p>

                      <p>Separation from mother should be a huge thing also.
                         Some years ago, I watched a documentary on Netflix
                         about orcas named Blackfish. This documentary
                         suggested that some of the whales were captive when
                         they were calves and separated from mother, causing
                         trauma. It is the same for any animal in the zoo.
                       </p>

                       <p>I do not like zoos, they are depressing for the
                          animals.<img id="mono" src="images/mono.gif" alt="" style="width:228px; height:228px;"> I have been to a few zoos, I visited Franklin
                          zoo, the Miami Dade zoo a day after I was in the zoo,
                          it came in the newspaper that the tiger escaped from
                          his cage. I was omg good thing it was not the day I
                          was there, and 2 more zoos in my country.</p>

                       <p>One of the reasons for zoos and benefits for people is
                          the learning of species. I would not know about the
                          existence of many animals if it would not for the zoo,
                          because the species are from other regions, some of
                          them from remote regions. Another good reason is you
                          can spend time with your family and encourage knowledge
                          to the kids.</p>

                      <p> A benefit for the animals is they can be studied,
                          researched and with that improve their life conditions
                          (for the next generation) not really for the ones that
                          are been studied.</p>
